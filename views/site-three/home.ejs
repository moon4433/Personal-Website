                Student. Helper. Geek.
            </h3>
            <p id="pnbbio">
                At my core, I am a student through and through. I never stop learning. I tend to see something and want
                to try to replicate it or try to complete a random goal that I set out for myself. If I don't know
                something, I find out the information I am looking for. I am always prodding and the gates of knowledge
                hoping to be let in once again. To achieve, one must strive for greatness. So in my day-to-day life, I
                always try to improve who I am. And this example is shown throughout my work. So I hope you would take
                the time to take a look at my accomplishments.
            </p>
            <p id="pnbbio">
                Secondly, I am a helper. I try to be that encouraging hand that is there to let you know that if you
                need the help, it is here ready to help. When I am helping someone, I feel like I accomplished
                something. I am always looking to lend a helping hand. I also like to fill in anywhere that new filling.
                Being helpful also show that one is useful, and I always appreciate being useful. This is also why I am
                always trying to learn and improve myself. Because the more useful I am, the more help I can provide to
                someone that needs it.
            </p>
            <p id="pnbbio">
                Lastly, I am a geek. I not only learn how to improve my skills. I also learn to improve my gaming. Yes,
                yes I am a geek, nerd, game, what have you. But this is how I enjoy my time when I'm not learning
                something new or trying to help someone with something. But in a way, I am doing both those with all the
                team games I play... But I digress.
