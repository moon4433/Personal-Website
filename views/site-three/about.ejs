        On this page you will learn things that you didn't know about me, some things you did know about me, and probably things that you wish you didn't learn about me... Okay. That last one isn't true. But what is true is that this page is all about me, so read at your own volition.

            "Extra! Extra! Read all about the amazing and wonderful Keegan the magnificent. He can do anything you challenge him to do. If you need a helping hand, he'll be there. There is nothing that he can't do! You want him to move the moon, He'll do it! Want him to scale a skyscraper, he'll do that to. He can do the impossible!"... Too much? Okay. Well here is a summary of me.
        </p>
        <p id="backgroundp2">
            To be completely honest, there isn't much to me. I enjoy video games, watching tv, and hanging out with my friends. I am just another average joe. In high school, I found the joy of creating websites, and that passion wasn't sparked up again until I got into college. But once I picked it back up, I hit the ground rolling. I wanted to learn all that there was to make a website. Well, that was more daunting than I realized, but I am slowly getting better at it.
        </p>
        <p id="backgroundp3">
            I tend to be stubborn when it comes to learning something. I am not satisfied until I have what I want to learn down to the T. I want to be the best I can be, so that I may bring my skills to go help the world. Okay. The world maybe a little too big, but I do hope to help people. Whether it be through my work, or what I do. I hope to change someone's day for the better.

            Who Am I?
        </h3>
        <p id="otherstuffp">
            I am a student through and through. I never stop learning. I tend to see something and want to try to replicate it or try to complete a random goal that I set out for myself. If I don't know something, I find out the information I am looking for. So in my day-to-day life, I always try to improve who I am. And this example is shown throughout my work. So I hope you would take the time to take a look at my accomplishments. Secondly, I am a helper. I try to be that encouraging hand that is there to let you know that if you need the help, it is here ready to help. When I am helping someone, I feel like I accomplished something. Lastly, I am a geek. I not only learn how to improve my skills. I also learn to improve my gaming. Yes, yes I am a geek, nerd, game, what have you. But this is how I enjoy my time when I'm not learning something new or trying to help someone with something. But in a way, I am doing both those with all the team games I play... But I digress.
